# 🌤️ Weather App – Real-Time Weather Dashboard

CodTech Internship – Task 1: API Integration

Built by: Raiyan

## 📌 Project Overview


This project is part of CodTech's Web Development Internship under Task 1: API Integration. The goal was to build a fully functional and visually appealing Weather Web App that interacts with a public API and dynamically fetches live weather data for any city entered by the user.

It showcases my ability to work with REST APIs, design responsive frontends, and add aesthetic, animated elements using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally Node.js (Express) for backend.



## 🌟 Key Features


🔎 City-based Weather Search


Users can input any city name to fetch live weather data.



## 🔄 Real-Time API Integration


Fetches temperature, weather conditions, and more using the OpenWeatherMap API.



## 💠 Glassmorphism UI


Clean, modern UI with glass-like cards, shadows, and smooth blur effects.



## 🌈 Animated Weather Background


Dynamic gradient background with animated sun, clouds, and text effects for immersive UX.



## 🎛️ Blur ON/OFF Toggle


Users can switch between blurred and sharp views of the UI for customization.



## 📱 Mobile Responsive


The app adapts beautifully across screen sizes—from mobile devices to large desktops.



## ✨ Animated Elements


Subtle animations like sliding headers, pulsing sun, and drifting clouds enhance the overall experience.



## 🧩 Tech Stack


Layer	Tools / Frameworks


Frontend	HTML5, CSS3 (Animations, Flexbox), JavaScript


Backend (Optional)	Node.js, Express (for API routing & local hosting)


API Source	OpenWeatherMap API

## 🚀 How to Run


🖥️ 1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/raiYan15/CODTECH-TASK-1-api-integration-)
cd weather-app


## 🌐 2. Open the app:


Just open index.html in your browser if you're using only frontend.



## 🔧 3. To run backend (optional):


bash
Copy code
npm install
node server.js
Visit: http://localhost:3000



## 🔑 API Key Setup (For OpenWeatherMap)


Visit https://openweathermap.org/api

Sign up and get your free API key

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in index.js with your actual key

js
Copy code
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";



## 🎓 What I Learned


Integrating and handling REST APIs in real-world scenarios

Working with DOM manipulation and async data fetching

Building stylish, animated frontend UIs

Making the app responsive and accessible

Adding optional Node.js backend to serve and manage API calls
